# Bijections Catalanes

Here is available my bachelor's intership rapport.

I worked on the research of involution on combinatorial 
objects count by the catalan numbers. 

The 6 weeks Intership was done in the LaBRI (Laboratoire Bordelais 
de Recherche en Informatique) with Yvan Le Borgne as my
internship supervisor. I was in the CombaAlgo department
and more prescisely in the Combinatory and Interaction Team.
